This is a modified version to work on a Wemos with an oled display.
 <br />
This my first project with Arduino and with the Wemos, so code can probably be tidied up or made more efficient. Sorry :)

You will require the following libraries:- <br />

The Wemos I used which I dont even know if its a real Wemos product was on ebay for Â£10, it includes a battery holder and oled 0.96" screen

I havent tested the battery voltage measurement, I believe you need a 470k resistor between the battery and the A0 pin, I dont have
a 470k resistor and I didnt have 18650 battery lol...

Anyway hope someone finds this useful

1, Setup Arduino
2, Download libraries and drivers
3, Change Wifi details 
4, Add your Nightscout URL and SHA fingerprint 
5, Change sleeptime for the number of minutes between checks of the site default is every 5 minutes.
