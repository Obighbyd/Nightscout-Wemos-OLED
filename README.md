# Nightscout-Wemos-OLED
Nightscout blood sugar display on a Wemos with an oled display


All credit and thanks goes to the original project by robjohnc at https://github.com/robjohnc/nightscout_wemos_epaper


This is a modified version to work on a Wemos with an oled display.


This my first project with Arduino and with the Wemos, so code can probably be tidied up or made more efficient. Sorry :)


You will require the following libraries:-

The Wemos I used which I dont even know if its a real Wemos product was on ebay for Â£10, it includes a battery holder and oled 0.96" screen, it was from these guys https://enigma-shop.com/index.php?option=com_hikashop&ctrl=product&task=show&cid=1009&name=wemos-esp-8266-board-with-0-96-oled-and-battery



I havent tested the battery voltage measurement, I believe you need a 470k resistor between the battery and the A0 pin, I dont have
a 470k resistor and I didnt have 18650 battery lol...


Anyway hope someone finds this useful

- 1, Setup Arduino
- 2, Download libraries and drivers
- 3, Change Wifi details 
- 4, Add your Nightscout URL and SHA fingerprint 
- 5, Change sleeptime for the number of minutes between checks of the site default is every 5 minutes.
